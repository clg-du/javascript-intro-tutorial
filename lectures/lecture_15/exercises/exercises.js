// Lecture 15 Exercises - While Loops

/* In this exercise, you will practice working with while loops in JavaScript.
Remember to log output to the console to see the results of your code. */

// Exercise 1: Write a while loop that logs the numbers from 1 to 5 to the
// console.

// Exercise 2: Write a while loop that logs the numbers from 5 to 1 to the
// console.

// Exercise 3: Write a while loop that logs the even numbers from 2 to 10 to the
// console.

// Exercise 4: Write a while loop that logs the numbers from 5 to 15, with a
// message "The current number is: " before each number.

// is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.

// Exercise 9: Write a while loop that logs the numbers from 1 to 100, but for
// multiples of 3, log "Fizz" instead of the number, and for multiples of 5, log
// "Buzz" instead of the number. For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5,
// log "FizzBuzz".
