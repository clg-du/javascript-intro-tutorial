// Lecture 16 Exercises - do...while Loops

/* In this exercise, you will practice working with do...while loops in JavaScript.
Remember to log output to the console to see the results of your code. */

// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Numbers in an Array
// In this exercise, you will calculate the sum of numbers in an array using a do...while loop.
// Follow the instructions below to complete the exercise:

// 1. Define an array of numbers with at least 5 elements.
// 2. Initialize a variable sum to store the sum of the numbers.
// 3. Initialize a variable i to store the index of the current number.
// 4. Use a do...while loop to iterate over the array of numbers.
// 5. Inside the loop, add the current number to the sum and increment the index.
// 6. Continue the loop while the index is less than the length of the array.
// 7. Log the sum to the console after the loop completes.

// Exercise 2: Find the Maximum Number in an Array
// In this exercise, you will find the maximum number in an array using a do...while loop.
// Follow the instructions below to complete the exercise:

// 1. Define an array of numbers with at least 5 elements.
// 2. Initialize a variable max to store the maximum number.
// 3. Initialize a variable i to store the index of the current number.
// 4. Use a do...while loop to iterate over the array of numbers.
// 5. Inside the loop, compare the current number with the maximum number.
// 6. If the current number is greater than the maximum number, update the maximum number.
// 7. Increment the index and continue the loop while the index is less than the length of the array.
// 8. Log the maximum number to the console after the loop completes.

// Exercise 3: Reverse a String
// In this exercise, you will reverse a string using a do...while loop.
// Follow the instructions below to complete the exercise:

// 1. Define a string with at least 5 characters.
// 2. Initialize a variable reversed to store the reversed string.
// 3. Initialize a variable i to store the index of the current character.
// 4. Use a do...while loop to iterate over the characters of the string.
// 5. Inside the loop, prepend the current character to the reversed string.
// 6. Increment the index and continue the loop while the index is less than the length of the string.
// 7. Log the reversed string to the console after the loop completes.
