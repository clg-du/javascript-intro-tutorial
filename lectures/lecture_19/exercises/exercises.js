// Lecture 19 Exercises - Break and Continue Statements

/* In this exercise, you will practice working with breaks and continue statements in JavaScript.
Remember to log output to the console to see the results of your code. */

// Exercise 1: Write a function that takes an array of numbers and uses a for loop
// to calculate the sum of the numbers. Use a break statement to exit the loop
// when the sum is greater than 10.

// Exercise 2: Write a function that takes an array of numbers and uses a for loop
// to calculate the sum of the numbers. Use a continue statement to skip any
// negative numbers in the array.

// Exercise 3: Write a function that takes an array of numbers and uses a for loop
// to find the first even number in the array. Use a break statement to exit the
// loop when an even number is found.

// Exercise 4: Write a function that takes an array of numbers and uses a for loop
// to find the index of the first negative number in the array. Use a continue
// statement to skip any positive numbers in the array.

// Exercise 5: Write a function that takes an array of numbers and uses a for loop
// to find the sum of the positive numbers in the array. Use a continue statement
// to skip any negative numbers in the array.

// Exercise 6: Write a function that takes an array of numbers and uses a for loop
// to find the product of the even numbers in the array. Use a continue statement
// to skip any odd numbers in the array.

// Exercise 7: Write a function that takes an array of numbers and uses a for loop
// to find the sum of the numbers until a negative number is encountered. Use a
// break statement to exit the loop when a negative number is found.
