// Lecture 12 - Conditional Statements

// Conditional statements are used to execute different blocks of code based on
// different conditions. The most common conditional statements in JavaScript are
// if statements, else statements, and else if statements.

// In this example, we demonstrate the use of if statements to check if a number
// is positive, negative, or zero.

// Define a number
let num = 5;

// Check if the number is positive
if (num > 0) {
  console.log("The number is positive.");
}

// Check if the number is negative
if (num < 0) {
  console.log("The number is negative.");
}

// Check if the number is zero
if (num === 0) {
  console.log("The number is zero.");
}

// In this example, we define a number and use if statements to check if the number
// is positive, negative, or zero. The if statements execute different blocks of
// code based on the condition being evaluated.

// Conditional statements are an essential part of control flow in JavaScript and
// are used to make decisions in your code based on different conditions.
