// Lecture 9 Exercises - Arrays

/* In this exercise, you will practice working with arrays in JavaScript.
Remember to log output to the console to see the results of your code. */

// Exercise 1: Declare an array named 'fruits' and assign it a list of fruits.

// Exercise 2: Use the 'length' property to determine the number of elements in
// the array. NOTE: The length property returns the number of elements in an
// array. It is an property, not a method, so it does not require parentheses.

// Exercise 3: Use the 'push' method to add a new fruit to the end of the array.

// Exercise 4: Use the 'pop' method to remove the last fruit from the array.

// Exercise 5: Use the 'unshift' method to add a new fruit to the beginning of the
// array.

// Exercise 6: Use the 'shift' method to remove the first fruit from the array.

// Exercise 7: Use the 'splice' method to remove the second fruit from the array.

// Exercise 8: Use the 'slice' method to create a new array that contains only the
// first three fruits from the original array.

// Exercise 9: Use the 'concat' method to combine the new array of fruits with the
// original array of fruits.

// Exercise 10: Use the 'join' method to create a string that contains all the
// fruits in the array separated by commas.

// Exercise 11: Use the 'indexOf' method to find the index of the first occurrence
// of 'cherry' in the array.

// Exercise 12: Use the 'lastIndexOf' method to find the index of the last occurrence
// of 'cherry' in the array.

// Exercise 13: Use the 'includes' method to determine if the array contains 'date'.

// Exercise 14: Use the 'reverse' method to reverse the order of the elements in the
// array.

// Exercise 15: Use the 'sort' method to sort the elements of the array in
// alphabetical order.
