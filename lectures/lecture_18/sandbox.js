// Lecture 18 - If Else Statements

// If else statements are used to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true,
// and another block of code if the condition is false. In JavaScript, if else statements
// are defined using the if keyword followed by a condition in parentheses, a block of code
// in curly braces, and an else keyword followed by another block of code in curly braces.

// In this example, we demonstrate the use of an if else statement to check if a number is
// positive or negative.

// Define a number
let num = 5;

// Check if the number is positive
if (num > 0) {
  console.log("The number is positive");
}
// If the number is not positive, check if it is negative
else {
  console.log("The number is not positive");
}

// In this example, we define a number and use an if else statement to check if the number
// is positive. If the number is positive, the first block of code will execute and log
// "The number is positive" to the console. If the number is not positive, the else block
// of code will execute and log "The number is not positive" to the console.

// If else statements are a powerful tool for controlling the flow of a program based on
// specified conditions. They allow you to execute different blocks of code depending on
// whether a condition is true or false.
